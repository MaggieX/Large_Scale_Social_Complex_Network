# Project 1: Random Graphs and Random Walks
This is the first project of ECE 232E Spring 2020:

"Large Scale Social and Complex Networks: Design and Algorithms"

## Team Members
Fahimeh Fakour (205 428 538)

Zhuyun Xiao (504 592 699)

Neng Wang (505 427 801)

## Prerequisite
This repo uses jupyter notebook based on R kernel.

Packages required: igraph, pracma, Matrix

## To Run the Code
To run the code, for all of these ipynb files, open the desired file in Jupyter Notebook and use Cell > Run All. 

We have divided the ipynb files based on the question in the project specification. 
1. project1_part1_Q1.ipynb	
2. project1_part1_Q2-m1.ipynb	
3. project1_part1_Q2-m2.ipynb
4. project1_part1_Q2-m5.ipynb
5. project1_part1_Q3.ipynb
6. project1_part2_Q1_Q2.ipynb
7. Project 1_PageRank.ipynb

NOTE: For Part 1 Question 2, we have included different project1_part1_Q2 files (project1_part1_Q2-m1.ipynb, project1_part1_Q2-m2.ipynb, and project1_part1_Q2-m5.ipynb) that have largely the same code, but different m values are set (m_val=1,2,or 5 in the different files). The code for 1.2.h is included in project1_part1_Q2-m1.ipynb.
