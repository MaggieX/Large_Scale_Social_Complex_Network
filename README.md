# Large Scale Social Complex Network
## Project 1: Random Graphs and Random Walks
- Generate Random Network using Erdös-Rényi (ER) model 
- Generate Random Network using preferential attachment model (barabasi)
- Performed Random Walk on ER networks
- Performed Random Walk on undirected preferential attachment network with fat-tailed distribution
- Random Walk to simulate PageRank
- Personalized PageRank

## Project 2: Social Network Mining
- Facebook Network
  -- Personalized Network
  -- Core node's personalized network
  -- Community strucutre found by 3 community detection algorithms: Fast-Greedy, Edge-Betweenness, Infomap
  -- Embeddednness and dispersion study of the nodes in personalize network
  -- Friend recommentation in networks using neighborhood based measure
- Google+ Network
  -- Community structure of the directed network

## Project 3: Reinforcement Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning
